		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:

<blockquote>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>

...or something like this:

<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickies to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>

As a new WordPress user, you should go to <a href="http://steps.dev/wp-admin/">your dashboard</a> to delete this page and create new pages for your content. Have fun!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>DANCE EXPLORATION</h2>
Our Dance Exploration classes provide beginning dancers an introduction to tap, jazz and ballet technique. The dancers will work on rhythm, balance, and coordination in fun and exciting atmosphere! These classes perform twice in our annual end of year recital. Dance Ex 1: Beginning 2-3 years old Dance Ex 2: 3-4 year olds Dance Ex 3: 4-5 year olds
<h2>BASIC TAP, JAZZ &amp; BALLET</h2>
Basic classes continue to build on the fundamentals of each of these styles. Bridging the gap from the dance exploration classes to the level 1 classes.
<h2>BALLET</h2>
Ballet is the foundation for all styles of dance. Students will develop flexibility, strength, control, coordination, line and musicality. Ballet Level 2 and above are required to take a minimum of two ballet classes per week. We suggest that every student at Steps Dance Center enroll in at least one ballet class.
<h2>POINTE</h2>
For those students who want to take their ballet training to the next level. Students must be recommended for pointe by their ballet instructor. Students must be enrolled in at least one additional ballet class per week.
<h2>JAZZ</h2>
Students will learn ballet based technique (turns, leaps, jumps) while learning to put them together in exciting, energetic combinations. Students will get to experience traditional jazz (Broadway, Fosse, Giordano) to Contemporary style jazz. TAP
Our tap classes focus on all the different styles of tap. Students can experience a range from the always entertaining Broadway style to the modern day style of hoofing. No matter what style they experience the art of producing rhythm with your feet is a great style to add to any dance repertoire!
<h2>HIP HOP</h2>
Steps hip hop classes explore multiple styles of the culture and all the current moves! Students will study both new school (jazz funk, krump, etc. ) to old school (popping, locking, breaking, whacking, voguing , etc… ) These classes will be sure to get you groovin’ with all the latest moves!
<h2>LYRICAL</h2>
Our lyrical classes fuse the technique and style of both ballet and jazz. Students work on expressing emotion while telling a story through the use of the lyrics and music. This is a great style for any dancer with training in ballet or jazz who want to expand their knowledge in different styles. Pre-requisite: Student must also be registered in the same level ballet or jazz class.
<h2>POM TECHNIQUE</h2>
Preparing for an audition or just want to brush up on your technical skills? Our pom technique class will get you conditioned and trained for any junior high, high school or college dance team. This class focuses on flexibility, pom motions, turns, jumps, leaps and tricks. This class is intended for middle school and high school aged students. PILATES
This Pilates class will consist of basic mat exercises with a focus on strengthening the core muscles of the body as well as improving whole-body coordination, flexibility and control. Students will progress at their own rate, and modifications will be made to accommodate injuries or other physical limitations. An exercise mat will be required for participation in this class.
<h2>TURNS &amp; TECHNIQUE</h2>
This is a jazz based class that focuses on the technical elements of jazz dancing. The emphasis will be on fine tuning technical elements such as pirouette turns, leaps and jumps, while also working on strength and conditioning.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Steps Dance Company is a competitive performance group comprised of students who are passionate about dance and want to take their talent to the next level. We believe that the Company experience instills values such as team work, responsibility, commitment, and discipline that our students can use outside of the classroom.

While we feel that competition inspires drive, teamwork, and good sportsmanship, we also highly value performance opportunities to give dancers a chance to reach out in their communities. The Steps Dance Company performs on a yearly basis at such events as:
<ul>
	<li>Kathryn Bender Memorial Showcase</li>
	<li>Katie Lunn Memorial Showcase</li>
	<li>Dance Chicago</li>
	<li>Dance.Live at UIC</li>
	<li>Fox Valley Showcase</li>
	<li>Fox Valley Children’s Safety Expo</li>
	<li>Naperville Labor Day Parade</li>
	<li>Dupage Children’s Museum</li>
	<li>McDonald’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</li>
	<li>Inaside Youth Summit for the Arts</li>
	<li>Making Strides Against Breast Cancer</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>
